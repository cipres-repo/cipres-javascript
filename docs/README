Cipres JavaScript Example

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This sample web application demonstrates a way to consume the CIPRES REST API service
using Ember.js. The application was developed using ember-cli (http://www.ember-cli.com/)
and utilizes the xml2json (http://www.thomasfrank.se/xml_to_json.html) library by Thomas Frank
for XML data parsing, as well as the Bootstrap CSS Framework (http://getbootstrap.com/)
 for styling of the application.

The application allows users to create, list, and view information for jobs using the
CIPRES REST API. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of JavaScript, the application does not allow
for downloading of outputted files. However, this can be remedied through proper server-side
 scripting. End user documentation (docs/end_user_documentation) can be found in the `docs` directory.

Prerequisites

	A local web server is all that is required to host the application. If you are unfamiliar with
	creating a web server, you may use static site hosting services such as bitballoon (https://www.bitballoon.com/)
	to host the application.

Preparation

	* Register for a CIPRES REST account (http://www.phylo.org/restusers)
	* Register a CIPRES REST application. Choose DIRECT authentication and make a note of the application ID that is assigned.
	* Within cipres-ember.zip, Update the file `api.json` to include your CIPRES Application ID

Running / Development

	* If you are using a service such as bitballoon, upload your modified cipres-ember.zip file to the service.
	* Otherwise, unzip the cipres-ember.zip file to the root of your local web server
